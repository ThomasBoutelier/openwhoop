# OpenWhoop

OpenWhoop is project that allows you to download heart rate data directly from your Whoop4.0 device without Whoop subscription or Whoops servers, making data your own.

### How to Run?

First you need to copy `.env.example` into `.env` and then scan until you find your Whoop device:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
cargo run -r -- scan
```

After you find your device:

On linux copy its address to `.env` under `WHOOP`, 

On macos copy its name to `.env` under `WHOOP`,  

After that you can download data from your whoop by running:
```sh
cargo run -r -- download-history
```

If you are using macos you should 

### Importing data to python

If you want to import heart rate data into python you can use following code:
```py
import pandas as pd
import os

QUERY = "SELECT time, bpm from heart_rate"
PREFIX = "sqlite:///" # This is prefix if you are working in same dir as `.env` if you are working in `notebooks/` change to `sqlite:///../`
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL").replace("sqlite://", PREFIX) 
df = pd.read_sql(QUERY, DATABASE_URL)
```
